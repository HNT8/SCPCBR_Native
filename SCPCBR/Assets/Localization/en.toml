p902 = "Designed by FN in conjunction with the FN Five-seven pistol and FN 5.7x28mm ammunition, development of the weapon began in 1986, and production commenced in 1990 (from which the ''90'' in its name is derived), whereupon the 5.7x28mm ammunition was redesigned and shortened. A modified version of the P90 with a magazine adapted to use the new ammunition was introduced in 1993, and the Five-seven pistol was subsequently introduced as a companion weapon using the same 5.7x28mm ammunition."
p903 = "Featuring a compact bullpup design with an integrated reflex sight and fully ambidextrous controls, the P90 is an unconventional weapon with a futuristic appearance.

scp0053 = "While SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any form of locking device, further experiments have shown that efforts to disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least somewhat successful in defeating SCP-005's ability."
scp0081 = "SCP-008 is a complex prion, samples of which are stored in each of the known G2 sites. Research into SCP-008 is highly classified and primarily aimed at preventing research which may lead to the synthesis of SCP-008 in the distant future."

scp0091 = "SCP-009 is approximately 3,700 liters of a substance which exhibits a number of unique properties. While small amounts of the substance, in all phases, are as colorless as mundane water, en masse it takes on a distinct deep red hue."
scp0092 = "Its most notable property, however, is the fact that SCP-009's reaction to temperature extremes is exactly opposite that of standard H2O: the subject assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100°C and 0°C, and converts into a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100°C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam, though it still retains its red coloration when put under high pressure."
scp0093 = "If the subject comes in contact with any biological source of heat, it begins a runaway reaction in which the living organism's bodily fluids are rapidly converted to SCP-009 and promptly frozen by their own body heat (because of their generally high core temperatures, mammals are particularly susceptible)."
scp0121 = "SCP-012 was retreived by Archaeologist K.M. Sandoval during the excavation of northern Italian tomb. The object, and piece of handwritten musical score entitled ''On Mount Golgotha'', appears to be incomplete."
scp0122 = "The red/black ink, first thought to be some form of berry or natural dye ink, was later found to be human blood from multiple subjects."
scp0123 = "Multiple test subjects have been allowed access to the score. In every case, the subjects mutilated themselves in order to use their own blood to finish the piece, resulting in subsequent symtoms of psychosis and massive trauma."
scp0351 = "SCP-035 appears to be a white porcelain comedy mask, although, at times, it will change to tragedy."
scp0352 = "When SCP-035 is placed on the face of an individual, an alternate brain wave pattern from SCP-035 overlaps that of the original host, effectively snuffing it out and causing brain damage to the subject. The subject then claims to be the conscousness contained within SCP-035."
scp0353 = "Psychological analysis has discovered SCP-035 to possess a highly manipulative nature, capable of forcing sudden and profound changes to the interviewer's psychological state. SCP-035 has proven to be highly sadistic, prompting some to commit suicide with linguistic persuasion alone."
scp0491 = "SCP-049 is humanoid in appearance, hovever, the Foundation is currently incapable of studying its face and body more fully, as it is covered in what appears to be the garb of the traditional Plague Doctor from 15-16th century Europe."
scp0492 = "SCP-049's touch is invariably lethal to humans. After contact with SCP-049's hand(s), the victim (hereafter referred to as SCP-049-2) suffers [DATA EXPUNGED] and dies within moments."
scp0493 = "SCP-049 then produces a bag made of [DATA EXPUNGED] containing scalpels, needles, thread, and several vials of an as-yet-unidentified substance and begins dissecting SCP-049-2, as well as inserting various chemicals into the body."

scp10331 = "When worn, it launches 12 (twelve) ultrathin probes into the body of the carrier (they were only found during the examination of the body of the carrier with [DATA REDACTED]), which penetrate into different parts of the body. The wearer at the same time experiences only a slight burning of the skin under the bracelet, which quickly passes."
scp10332 = "For each action that protects the carrier, the object takes away some of its blood, depending on the level of threat. Complete bleeding is possible, the user dies while the SCP-1033 separates from it.If the carrier removes the object itself, then for a while (from 2 (two) weeks to 3 (three) months) the regeneration of blood is greatly slowed, even if the protection mechanism has not been activated once."
scp10481 = "SCP-1048 is a small teddy bear, approximately 33 cm in height. Through testing, composition of the subject revealed no unusual qualities that make it discernible from a non-sapient teddy bear."
scp10482 = "Subject is capable of moving of its own accord, and can communicate through a small range of gestures. The subject regularly shows affection to individuals in ways found endearing by most people."
scp10483 = "Affection is usually given in the form of a hug to the lower leg, but subject has also been observed dancing, jumping in place, and in two separate events it has even drawn child-like pictures for personnel."
scp10484 = "SCP-1048 uses its endearing qualities to lull those around it in to a false sense of security, allowing it to collect materials to produce these creations. The nature of these creations has been in stark contrast to SCP-1048's general behavior, as all have exhibited extreme violence towards humans."
scp1048a = "Coarse copy of SCP-1048. Completely composed of human ears. By making a thin squeal, the body of any person (including internal organs) within a radius of 10 meters is covered with outgrowths, similar to ears."
scp1061 = "SCP-106 appears to be an elderly humanoid, with a general appearance of advanced decomposition. This appearance may vary, but the ''rotting'' quality is observed in all forms."
scp1062 = "SCP-106 causes a ''corrosion'' effect in all solid matter it touches, engaging a physical breakdown in materials several seconds after contact. This is observed as rusting, rotting, and cracking of materials, and the creation of black, mucus-like substance similar to the material coating SCP-106"
scp1063 = "SCP-106 can pass through solid matter and will capture and kill its prey by pulling it into what is assumed to be its personal ''pocket dimension''."
scp10791 = "All instances of SCP-1079 are currently stored within Containment Locker-1079 at Site-19. Furthermore, watchlist databases are to be updated with SCP-1079's information, in order to intercept any new shipments which may appear in the future."
scp10792 = "SCP-1079 is the designation given to a number of sweets brightly labelled ''Dr. Wondertainment's Bubblebath Bonbons!®''. Currently, the Foundation has - crates of SCP-1079 in containment, originally containing 64 packets each."
scp10793 = "Human subjects report tingling sensations immediately after the consumption of SCP-1079. Ten to fifteen seconds later, the subject's own blood is secreted as pink, bubblegum-scented foam from the subject's pores on their abdomen, arms and back. The total volume of blood secreted in this way is typically from 30-50 mL and does not pose an immediate health risk."
scp10794 = "He volume of blood secreted increases exponentially as more pieces are consumed; bubbles form in the subject's blood as a consequence of the SCP's intended function, causing the subject's blood to boil. Death by exsanguination occurs in 95% of subjects who have consumed 4 or more candies in one sitting. Exsanguination is compounded by foam collecting in the lungs of the consumer."
scp1091 = "SCP-109 is a standard-issue United States Army canteen (circa 1899) made of a tin alloy and fitted with a heavy cotton cover and a black leather strap."
scp1092 = "When opened, the item is seen to be nearly full of water. A seemingly unlimited amount of water can be removed from the container without changing the water level or the item's mass, which remains a constant 3.16 kg. Probes of the interior of the container reported an estimated volume of 2.8 L and a shape consistent with the outside."
scp11231 = "SCP-1123 is a human skull missing the lower mandible and all its teeth. Across the exterior squama frontalis is modern Khmer script, written in human blood, that translates as ''Remember''."
scp11232 = "Genetic testing confirms that both the skull and the blood are from the same individual. The Khmer script is badly faded, and invisible to most subjects beyond 5 meters distance."
scp11233 = "Subjects at 1 meter or less from the object will report the blood being fresh, as if ''still wet'', as well as other anomalous sensory phenomena, including smells, sounds, and tactile responses."
scp11621 = "SCP-1162 is, currently, a hole in the cinderblock wall of Containment Chamber 4 at Site ██."
scp11622 = "SCP-1162 is activated when a sentient being reaches into the holes, at which point their fingers touch a solid surface similar in feel to the current location of SCP-1162, and they discover an item small enough to fit through the hole."
scp11623 = "These items have universally been recognized as something that the user has lost, or was searching for at some point during their life."
scp1481 = "SCP-148 is a metallic substance, composed of a variety of known and unknown elements."
scp1482 = "SCP-148 has shown the ability to block or otherwise hinder extrasensory mind-affecting properties of living organisms in proximity to it."
scp1483 = "This effect, while difficult to quantify, appears inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the subject to SCP-148's surface and directly proportional to the quantity of SCP-148 in consideration."
scp14991 = "SCP-1499 is a Soviet GP-5 gas mask. A seal test performed on the object suggests that the object retains its original functionality."
scp14992 = "The anomalous effects of SCP-1499 activate when a human places SCP-1499 on their head. Approximately one second after SCP-1499 is fully secured on the subject's head, the subject vanishes from view, and is no longer detectable."
scp14993 = "Upon wearing SCP-1499, test subjects report completely different surroundings than they were in prior to wearing SCP-1499."
scp1731 = "SCP-173 is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. It is animate and extremely hostile."
scp1732 = "The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must not be broken at any time with SCP-173. Personnel assigned to enter SCP-173's containment are instructed to alert one another before blinking."
scp1781 = "SCP-178 is a pair of white stereoscopic (''3-D'') glasses with a rectangular white cardboard frame and lenses of transparent blue and red (left and right lenses, respectively) plastic. The item exhibits no unusual physical properties apart from a slight discoloration of the cardboard consistent with age."
scp1782 = "When worn, the wearer begins perceiving large bipedal entities in addition to its ordinary surroundings. Entities reportedly exhibit a docile and occasionally curious behavior, with one exception."
scp1783 = "Any attempt by the wearer or any other personnel to directly interact with the entities results in severe lacerations suddenly appearing on persons involved."
scp1981 = "Anomalous behavior does not manifest until a live human being grasps SCP-198 to hold it. Approximately 2 - 5 seconds after the SCP is held, it will instantly bond itself through unknown, albeit painful means to the handler's hand or hands. Test subjects have reported the pain of bonding with SCP-198 as a \"searing\" or \"fiery\" sensation, though no heat can be detected by outside observers or instruments."
scp1982 = "Once bonded, any liquid inside SCP-198 will disappear and the container will inexplicably begin to fill from the bottom-up with a fluid or a semi-solid material, stopping only once it reaches the top of the container. Once SCP-198 has filled, the holder will undergo rapid dehydration and/or emaciation, becoming increasingly malnourished to the point of death, which usually occurs within 24 hours if nothing is done to prevent it."
scp1983 = "Ingestion of standard foods, liquids, or I.V.-supplied nutrients does nothing to reverse or slow this process. Testing has revealed that the only means by which the subject can gain nourishment is by consuming the contents of SCP-198; however, the constant rate of dehydration and emaciation remains the same, forcing the test subject to consume vast quantities of the excretions almost constantly to remain alive."
scp2051 = "SCP-205 is a pair of flood lamps used in photography. The light emitted by each lamp behaves in a manner unique to SCP-205 and passes completely through any surface that is not colored white."
scp2052 = "If the light continues uninterrupted through any matter, otherwise casting no shadow, each lamp will display an unidentified young woman's shadow upon any flat white surface, such as the projection screen in Chamber 52."
scp2071 = "The practical effect of this is when a subject drinks SCP-207-1, they will effectively no longer require sleep or rest, nor attempt to sleep or rest. This effect is not lessened by any soporific or medication yet tested on test subjects. However, only a quantity larger than five (5) millilitres will cause this effect."
scp2072 = "In addition to removing the need for rest, SCP-207-1 also causes an increase in motor, reaction, and psychological functions. The increase is linear in progression, with an estimated 50% increase (measured by standard medical protocols, +/-5%) every 6 hours. The practical application of ingestion is that the subject is able to think, react, and move faster than others who have not ingested SCP-207-1. Mental proficiencies show the IQ of the subject to rise in line with other increases."
scp2073 = "However, SCP-207-1 does not alter the body of affected subjects. Physiology remains unchanged, and as such, can rarely support the increase in activity. No subjects have lasted longer than 48 hours during testing, with the cause of death varying from massive internal organ failure to exsanguination due to major artery ruptures. Subjects also begin to show stress after roughly 24 hours, usually making each movement extremely carefully, in order to avoid accidents."
scp2151 = "When worn, SCP-215 induces a belief in the wearer that inanimate objects are sentient and capable of communication with the wearer. The severity of this delusion varies from wearer to wearer, but generally strengthens over time if SCP-215 is worn regularly, and in the worst cases manifests as a severe case of obsessive-compulsive disorder, culminating in an irrational fear of all machines."
scp2152 = "There is no definite ''safe'' amount of time to wear SCP-215; while the onset of delusions generally takes at least twenty-four (24) hours, a great deal depends on the psychological disposition of the wearer before SCP-215 is put on, and persons who already have some varieties of obsessive-compulsive, synesthesiac, or technophiliac disorders have been known to begin suffering SCP-215's effects less than an hour after donning it."
scp2153 = "Removing SCP-215 does not remove the delusion, although normal methods of therapy have proven to be effective in less severe cases so long as SCP-215 is not put on again; a full recovery can turn to a full relapse in less than a day by the return of SCP-215. By the end of the second week, wearers tend to violently resist any attempt to separate them from SCP-215."
scp2941 = "Item SCP-294 appears to be a standard coffee vending machine, the only noticeable difference being an entry touchpad with buttons corresponding to an English QWERTY keyboard."
scp2942 = "Upon entering the name of any liquid using the touchpad, a standard 12-ounce paper drinking cup is placed and the liquid indicated is poured."
scp2943 = "Ninety-seven initial test runs were performed (including requests for water, coffee, beer, and sofa, non-consumable liquids such as sulfuric acid, wiper fluid, and motor oil, as well as substances that do not usually exist in liquid state, such as nitrogen, iron, and glass) and each one returned a success."
scp3571 = "When permitted to physically interact with SCP-357, researchers describe it as having a consistency similar to that of Play-Doh brand modeling compound. However, unlike Play-Doh, SCP-357 will not retain its shape for any length of time if left at rest. It will settle at a rate of approximately 0.5 cm per minute until it reproduces the shape of the inside of its container. SCP-357 will form a meniscus inside the container 7.5 cm high."
scp3572 = "The thickness of the substance at the top of the meniscus is 1 mm, at which point it merges with the surface of the container following a Gaussian curve. If allowed to settle on a flat surface, SCP-357 will spread until its average thickness is no more than 1 mm. The edge of the mass follows the same Gaussian function that is seen in the meniscus."
scp3573 = "If solid matter is placed in a container of SCP-357, it will sink into the substance at a constant rate of 0.5 cm per minute. SCP-357 will displace the appropriate volume as any other fluid would. If the solid object is fully absorbed by SCP-357, it will become impossible to distinguish between it and the substance of SCP-357. Theories range from the object taking on the properties of SCP-357 to the object being replaced by a corresponding volume of SCP-357."
scp3721 = "SCP-372 is a creature of unknown genus, approximately 6.5 ft long from head to tail and weghing approximately 99.2 libs. It has a long, thin body with eight pairs of narrow limbs."
scp3722 = "SCP-372 has learned to predict the movements of any being around it, and uses this technique to hide behind the head of a person looking for it, or in any of their blind spots."
scp3723 = "In the vent of a containment breach, all personnel are advised to report any brief flickering movement sin the corner of their eyes."
scp4021 = "SCP-402 is an irregularly-shaped solid weighing 4kg. While SCP-402 is composed largely of obsidian, trace amounts of platinum and iridium are present. SCP-402's structure has numerous abnormal microscopic gaps similar to those found in SCP-148; this, along with SCP-402's anomalous density (22.2g/cm3, roughly 8.5 times that of obsidian), suggests that the two materials operate under similar principles"
scp4022 = "Any water that comes in contact with SCP-402 (hereby SCP-402-A) develops antimemetic properties, effectively rendering it imperceptible by any direct means. Witnesses typically interpret this as SCP-402 absorbing the water. SCP-402-A can be detected through its interaction with other materials, which occurs normally."
scp4023 = "Consumption of SCP-402-A presents a serious choking hazard, as its presence in the trachea does not trigger the laryngospasm responsible for sealing the airway. SCP-402-A's presence in the lungs is only detectable via the resultant oxygen deprivation, and is typically mistaken for other medical conditions, which prevents proper treatment. Safe handling of SCP-402-A can only be performed by trained personnel."
scp4091 = "SCP-409 resembles a large quartz crystal approximately 1.5m (5ft) tall and 0.6m (2ft) wide."
scp4092 = "Any objects coming in contact with SCP-409 will begin to crystallize."
scp4093 = "After complete crystallization, the object will begin to make snapping and creaking noises for approximately twenty minutes, before bursting into thousands of fragments with great force."
scp4271 = "SCP-427 is a small, spherical, ornately carved locket made of a polished silver material. The ornate carvings do not seem to serve any function."
scp4272 = "SCP-427 was created after placing a pill of SCP-500 in the Input booth of SCP-914 and using the Fine setting. It displays no unusual activity when closed. When SCP-427 is opened and exposed to biological tissue, it rapidly regenerates cellular damage and somehow is able to purge invading compounds or infections."
scp4273 = "However, long-term exposure produces a significant health hazard. As the locket heals damage, it optimizes the body's natural systems. Class-D personnel exposed to the device for over an hour total began mutating into a shapeless mass of tissue."
scp4274 = "The ''Flesh Beasts'' created by SCP-427 are incredibly aggressive, attacking any and all personnel on sight with nethal results. They are highly resistant to most known weaponry."
scp4471 = "SCP-447-1 is a green sphere approximately 5 cm in diameter, with a spongy surface texture and a weight of 1.37 kg. The object is warm to the touch, approximately the same temperature as a human body."
scp4472 = "Although malodorous, the slime harvested from SCP-447-1 is nontoxic, noncorrosive, and nonradioactive. The slime is edible, and reportedly makes a good salad dressing."
scp4473 = "Under no circumstances is SCP-447 to be allowed to come into contact with dead bodies."
scp4571 = "For all points and purposes, SCP-457 appears to be a sentient being composed of flame. SCP-457's actual composition is unknown, and has proven to be invisible and undetectable by any known means, but is shaped out by the flames it produces, often assuming a human-like form if given sufficient fuel to assume that size."
scp4572 = "SCP-457's most rudimentary form appears to be that of a single flame, comparable in size to that of a matchstick. In this form, SCP-457 possesses only the simplest of directives and shows no signs of being unusual compared to any other flame beyond a penchant for suddenly flickering to burn human hands, and the ability to 'jump' to more flammable materials or other flames, which it then assimilates into its total form."
scp4573 = "As SCP-457 grows larger, it is able to assume more complex shapes, and its intelligence grows with size and fuel sources. SCP-457's method of intelligence is unknown, but upon reaching an approximately human size, SCP-457 almost always assumes a human-like form surrounded by and composed of flames."
scp5001 = "SCP-500 is a small plastic can which at the time of writing contains forty-seven (47) red pills."
scp5002 = "One pill, when taken orally, effectively cures the subject of all diseases within two hours, exact time depending on the severity and amount of the subject's conditions."
scp5003 = "Despite extensive trials, all attempts at synthesizing more of what is thought to be the active ingredient of the pills have been unsuccessful."

scp9662 = "Their hunting methods consist on emitting a single burst of a previously unknown type of wave, which permanently inhibits the ability of the affected creature to enter in any of the NREM and REM sleep stages. The ability to micro sleep is also lost."
scp9663 = "After depriving their victims of sleep, SCP-966 will stalk their prey until the lack of rest incapacitates it. At this point, SCP-966 will proceed to consume it."
scp9701 = "SCP-970 is a spatial phenomenon wherein a collection of rooms are looped on themselves. In all cases found, this is by means of a series of doors appearing in the walls, all in a straight line, such that it is possible to walk forwards and end up at the starting position."
