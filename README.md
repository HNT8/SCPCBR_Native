# SCP: Containment Breach Remastered v2
<i>This is the official version 2+ repository for SCP: Containment Breach Remastered.</i>

## The Original Game
SCP: Containment Breach Remastered had a rocky start. The release window I originally chose was way too early for the state of the game at the time. Not many features were added, not many bugs were patched, and it didn't contain any brand new features or bug fixes, which has given us a rocky reputation in the SCP community. Over the past two years I've made tons of progress improving the game, adding features, fixing bugs, and even implementing a modding system (which still isn't finished). But with SCP: Containment Breach as a whole, there is only so much you can do within the limitations of the original game engine Blitz3D. Along with hitting limitations in the engine, I have been very busy outside of developing this game with things such as school and work which is why I have started this project and slowed down the development of v1 of SCP: Containment Breach Remastered.

## My Plan
Completely remaking the game in another language with modern technology is no easy feat. Especially working on my own. I plan to continue development of this project in my free time whenever possible, but I can't guarantee a release time or even guarantee release at all. If development of this project stops, notice will be given, but as of now, the project is under development.

This project is a faithful recreation of SCP: Containment Breach Remastered v1 created in C++ using modern technology. The game is targeted at 64-bit at the moment, using OpenGL as our rendering API. I plan on using Dear ImGui for our UI framework.

Overall, if this project ends up being completed, it will be revolutionary for the SCP: Containment Breach community as a whole. The performance compared to the original game will be immensely improved depending on the intensity of graphics we will target in the future.

## Contributing

I don't plan on working on this project alone. It would take me an insane amount of time without help. If you are an experienced developer and would be interested in contributing to the project, please contact me and provide me with details about yourself and your development experience.

## Disclaimer & License
The game is based on the works of the SCP Foundation community (https://www.scp-wiki.net/) as well as the SCP: Containment Breach modding community as a whole.
